				<div class ="aboutContent">
					<p>We are small local skateboard company who specialize in making boards for riders who believe in the dream of skateboarding. The idea for the board42 came to the team while brainstorming how to shoot and create a video documenting the a "natural elments" that a skateboarder has with his board.<p>

					<p>Designed in San Francisco by three guys (Dave, Mike and Saen) who have a passion and incredible stamina for skateboarding. Our boards are designed out of recycled old skateboards, and handcrafted to best suit each buyers needs. This makes each one, one of a kind. We wanted to create a board that has already been broken in by the previos users of the combined boards to create that natural feel. We dedicate our time to make sure our products are unqiue by getting local artists to be featured and create a board for us. We want to bring together the local art and skateboarding scene to create a community and encourage more collaboration.</p>

					<p>Designed for skaters who believe in the natural feel of a broken in board. Our product is designed, built and quality tested to be best suited for a true skaters needs.</p>
